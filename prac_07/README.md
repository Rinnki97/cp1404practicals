## About the Author

I am [YuLin Chen], a student of James Cook University. I am constantly striving to improve my skills and learn new techniques to create efficient, maintainable, and user-friendly applications.

## Lessons Learned About Clean Code

Throughout this course, I have learned several important lessons about writing clean code:

1. **Naming**: Choose meaningful and descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes to make the code more understandable and maintainable.
2. **Comments and Documentation**: Provide clear and concise comments to explain the purpose and behavior of code, as well as using docstrings for functions and classes.
3. **Code Structure**: Use appropriate whitespace, indentation, and line breaks to make the code more readable, and follow established language conventions and style guides.
